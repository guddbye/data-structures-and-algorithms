## Blog Notes: Insertion Sort

## Challenge Summary

Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm that uses a nested loop to iterate through a list and sort its values. It uses a temp variable to store the current value and compare it with previous values in the list. It effectively shifts the values up the list if they are greater than the temp value. After iterating through the list and performing this comparison for each value, the list will be properly ordered.
