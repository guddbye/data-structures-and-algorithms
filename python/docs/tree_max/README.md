## Challenge Summary

Find the max value in a tree. Given a tree find the highest value in that tree.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O Space - O(1) - Method only uses the space of one variable which is already allocated and ready for it.
Big O Time - O(n) - As the linked list gets longer, it takes more time to iterate through

## Solution
Run the tests by running: pytest-watch
