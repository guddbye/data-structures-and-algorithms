## challenge summary

This challenge required us to create a function called breadth_first that takes in a tree and returns a list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered.

## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency

Time: O(n) because it takes longer to process a bigger stack, time efficiency is linear.
Space: O(n) Due to the fact that the array needed to print the values of the tree will grow in size as the stack does, the efficiency for space is linear.


## Solution

Run the tests by running: pytest test_tree_breadth_first.py
