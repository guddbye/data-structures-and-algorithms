# Challenge Summary

This challenge required us to create a function that takes two Binary Trees as input and returns a list of values that were found in both trees.

## Whiteboard Process
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O Time: O(N) because we have to iterate through each node in both trees.
Big O Space: O(N) because if all values in the trees are matching, then the list of matches will be as big as the input tree.
