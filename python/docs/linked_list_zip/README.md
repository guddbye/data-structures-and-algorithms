# Challenge Summary
Create a function called zip_lists that takes in two linked lists and returns one new linked list. Merge the two lists together by adding each node to the new list, alternating between the nodes in each list.

## Whiteboard Process


## Approach & Efficiency
Create the function zip_lists that takes two linked lists as an input.
Create a counter variable.
Set length variable equal to the length of the longest list.
Create an outer loop that will control the counter and iteration of both loops.

Create two nested loops, for each list it iterates through.
Once each list has added one node, increment the counter and allow the loops to append the next node. Adding the next value.
Return the new single linked list.
