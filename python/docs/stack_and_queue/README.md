## Stacks and Queues
Data structures called stacks and queues both store values in linked nodes. Queues employ a LILO data scheme, whereas stacks employ a LIFO data scheme. Because you always work with the node that is on top of the stack, stacks operate as a stack of nodes. In a similar way, queues work like a line of nodes, with you always interacting with the node at the front of the line.

## Challenge
We had to create push, pop, peek, and is_empty methods for both the Stack and Queue class. This allows us to add a new node to the top or rear, remove the top or front node and return its value, look at the value of the top or front node, and check if the Stack or Queue is empty and return the appropriate error.
