## Approach & Efficiency
Big O Time: I believe it is O(N) because we have to iterate through every word in the string. This means that time increases in direct proportion to the size of the input.

Big O Space: I believe it is O(N) because in the worst case scenario, we will have a words_seen list that contains every word from the input. This means that storage space increases in direct proportion to the size of the input.
